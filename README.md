# Chess Gui

## Overview

This is an open source chess gui.

Developped in C++ using the open source Qt framework.

This gui is a Work in Progress and is not useable right now.

## State of the art

As of today, finding a chess gui is a compelling task. 
Most open source (or free) guis have an outdated look and commercial guis are both massively expensive and under-optimized. 
Those problems make working on oppenings frustrating and may discourage many advanced chess players.
The advent of online chess has brought an other option: working and practising on websites. 
This brings another issue: our data is then hosted on the cloud and we loose some degree of control over our training.

## Expectations

Final expectations for this project are:
* a easy-to-use, lightweight chess gui with a clean look and feel
* being able to use this gui for training, playing, browsing databases and working on oppenings
* being able to import and use various UCI engines
* being able to test and benchmark various UCI engines

A first useable version of this product should be available before the end of September 2023

## TODO

* Reorder the .h/.cpp files in a src folder
* Add the different features highlighted in the <b>Overview</b> section
